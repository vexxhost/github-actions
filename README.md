# `github-actions`

This repository contains a collection of reusable GitHub actions and wworkflows
which are used within our GitHub organization.

## Usage

The documentation for each action is available in the folder of the action itself,
however here is a quick overview of each action:

- `build-docker-image`: Build a Docker image, scan it for vulnerabilities, and
  optionally push it to the GitHub container registry.
